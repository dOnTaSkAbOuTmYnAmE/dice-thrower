# DICE THROWER

Ya put in some numbers, ya get some graphs.

If ye wanna simulate 1 million quadrillion bizillion throws, then good luck waiting, but should be good up to a 10_000_000 (Might take a few minutes though)

## HOW TO INSTALL
Get yer Git. Get yer NPM
Install it to a folder, go there with yer CMD, use `'npm install'` or simply `'npm i'` and then `'npm run dev'`
You should get a message with `localhost` link attached. Put it in browser and *voila* (Or hoverew you write that)

## ALSO

The graphs ain't perfect

More things are (probably) not gonna be added as I'm gonna forget about this project and move to another one

## SO HAVE FUN
destroying it and looking for bugs :)
