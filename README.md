# dice-thrower

Ya put in some numbers, ya get some graphs.

If ye wanna simulate 1 million quadrillion bizillion throws, then good luck waiting, but should be good up to a 10_000_000 (Might take a few minutes though)

## ALSO

The graphs ain't perfect

More things are (probably) not gonna be added as I'm gonna forget about this project and move to another one

## So HAVE FUN

destroying it and looking for bugs :)
